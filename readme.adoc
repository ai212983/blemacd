Blemacd is a macOS daemon to control BLE devices via Unix socket.
This is a pet project mainly to control https://www.philips-hue.com/en-us/p/hue-white-ambiance-1-pack-e26/046677548490[Philips Hue White Ambiance BLE bulb]
via https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/[Keyboard Maestro] and/or http://www.hammerspoon.org/[Hammerspoon].

It is based on Apple's {url-corebt}[CoreBluetooth library] and its {url-corebt-wrapper}[Rust wrapper].

== Open questions

* Better docs and HUE instructions
* Handle or limit multiple connections?
** Confirmation on command result (like status change)
* Populating list of devices may be done by different API calls:
** `CentralManager::get_peripherals`/ `retrievePeripheralsWithIdentifiers`
** `CentralManager::get_peripherals_with_services`, `retrieveConnectedPeripheralsWithServices`
** `CentralManager::scan scanForPeripheralsWithServices` (https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corebluetooth/cbcentralmanager/1518986-scanforperipherals[CoreBluetooth docs])
* Looks like some peripherals can have multiple names?

=== Backlog

* Better status (include path, number of connections and uptime?)
* Better https://rust-cli.github.io/book/in-depth/signals.html[signals handling], namely `Ctrl+C`
* Options for commands (like format output)
* Homebrew formula
* Colorize output?
** https://crates.io/crates/colored
** https://docs.rs/termcolor
** https://crates.io/crates/ansi_term
** https://crates.io/crates/termion
* Show info:
** UUID, RSSI in decibels
** advertisement data: Service UUIDs, connectable, local_name
** manufacturer data?
